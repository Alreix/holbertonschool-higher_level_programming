# Python - Import Modules

This directory contains Python scripts focused on using modules and importing functions, variables, and names from different files.  
The goal of this project is to understand how to perform imports, manage namespaces, handle arguments from the command line, and work with external modules.

## Project Structure

- `0-add.py`  
  Script that imports the function `add` from `add_0.py` and prints the result of an addition.

- `1-calculation.py`  
  Script that imports a calculator module and performs basic mathematical operations.

- `2-args.py`  
  Script that prints the number of arguments and lists them using `sys.argv`.

- `3-infinite_add.py`  
  Script that adds all command-line arguments together.

- `4-hidden_discovery.py`  
  Script that prints names defined in a hidden module.

- `5-variable_load.py`  
  Script that imports a variable from a module and prints its value.
