# Python - More Data Structures

This directory contains Python exercises that focus on additional data structure concepts such as sets, dictionaries, and iterable transformations.  
The goal of this project is to manipulate data using built-in structures while practicing functional programming tools and simple algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `0-square_matrix_simple.py`  
  Function that returns a new matrix with each value squared.

- `1-search_replace.py`  
  Function that replaces all occurrences of an element in a list.

- `2-uniq_add.py`  
  Function that returns the sum of unique integers in a list.

- `3-common_elements.py`  
  Function that returns a set of common elements between two sets.

- `4-only_diff_elements.py`  
  Function that returns the symmetric difference of two sets.

- `5-number_keys.py`  
  Function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

- `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`  
  Function that prints a dictionary sorted by keys.

- `7-update_dictionary.py`  
  Function that updates or adds a key/value in a dictionary.

- `8-simple_delete.py`  
  Function that deletes a key in a dictionary safely.

- `9-multiply_by_2.py`  
  Function that returns a new dictionary with values multiplied by 2.

- `10-best_score.py`  
  Function that returns the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary.

- `11-multiply_list_map.py`  
  Function that returns a new list with all values multiplied by 2 using `map`.

- `12-roman_to_int.py`  
  Function that converts a Roman numeral into an integer.

- `main.py`  
  Auxiliary test file for checking behavior (not part of the tasks).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- Code must follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.\*)
- Functions must be documented
- Use of `set`, `map`, and dictionary methods encouraged
