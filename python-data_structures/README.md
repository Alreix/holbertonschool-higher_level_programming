# PYTHON - DATA STRUCTURE

## Python — Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project introduces basic data structures in Python, mainly focusing on lists, indexing, slicing, iterations, and strings manipulation.
Each task implements a small function to practice operating on lists, tuples, and strings without imports.

## Tasks Overview
0. Print a list of integers

Goal: Print all integers in a list, one per line, using str.format().

1. Secure access to an element in a list

Goal: Retrieve an element by index.
Return None if the index is negative or out of range.

2. Replace element

Goal: Replace the value at a given index in a list.
If the index is invalid, return the original list unchanged.

3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!

Goal: Print all integers of a list in reverse order, using str.format().

4. Replace in a copy

Goal: Create a copy of a list and replace the element at a given index.
Return the original list if the index is invalid.

5. No C in string

Goal: Return a new string that removes all characters c and C.
No imports and no replace() allowed.
