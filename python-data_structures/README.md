# PYTHON - DATA STRUCTURE

## Python — Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project introduces basic data structures in Python, mainly focusing on lists, indexing, slicing, iterations, and strings manipulation.
Each task implements a small function to practice operating on lists, tuples, and strings without imports.

## Tasks Overview
0. Print a list of integers

Goal: Print all integers in a list, one per line, using str.format().

1. Secure access to an element in a list

Goal: Retrieve an element by index.
Return None if the index is negative or out of range.

2. Replace element

Goal: Replace the value at a given index in a list.
If the index is invalid, return the original list unchanged.

3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!

Goal: Print all integers of a list in reverse order, using str.format().

4. Replace in a copy

Goal: Create a copy of a list and replace the element at a given index.
Return the original list if the index is invalid.

5. No C in string

Goal: Return a new string that removes all characters c and C.
No imports and no replace() allowed.

6. Lists of lists = Matrix

Goal: Print a matrix (list of lists) of integers.
Each row must be printed on a new line.
Output must not include trailing spaces.

7. Tuples addition

Goal: Add two tuples element-wise and return a new tuple with 2 integers.
If a tuple has fewer than 2 elements, missing values are treated as 0.
If it has more than 2, only the first two elements are considered.

8. More returns!

Goal: Return a tuple containing the length of a string and its first character.
If the string is empty, the first character must be None.

9. Find the max

Goal: Return the largest integer from a list.
If the list is empty, return None.
No use of max() builtin.

10. Only by 2

Goal: Return a new list of boolean values where each index corresponds to whether the value at the same position in the input list is divisible by 2.
The new list has the same size as the original.

11. Delete at

Goal: Remove an element from a list at a specified index without using .pop().
If the index is negative or out of range, return the list unchanged.

12. Switch

Goal: Swap the values of variables a and b in the given source code.
Swap must be done in one line, with no extra variables.
Final script must be exactly 5 lines long.
