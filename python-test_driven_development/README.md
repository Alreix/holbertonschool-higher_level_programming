# Python - Test Driven Development

This directory contains a set of Python exercises focused on the principle of **Test Driven Development (TDD)**.  
The goal of the project is to write functions and validate their behavior using tests written before or alongside the implementation.

All tests for this project are located in the `tests/` directory and include both doctest-style `.txt` tests and unittest-based Python tests.

## Project Structure

- `0-add_integer.py`  
  Function for adding two integers.

- `2-matrix_divided.py`  
  Function that divides all elements of a matrix.

- `3-say_my_name.py`  
  Function that prints a formatted full name.

- `4-print_square.py`  
  Function that prints a square using the `#` character.

- `5-text_indentation.py`  
  Function that formats a text by inserting new lines after specific punctuation.

- `tests/`  
  Contains the test files for all functions in this directory:
  - `0-add_integer.txt`
  - `2-matrix_divided.txt`
  - `3-say_my_name.txt`
  - `4-print_square.txt`
  - `5-text_indentation.txt`
  - `6-max_integer_test.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- Tests use **doctest** and **unittest**
- Code must follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.\*)
- All modules and functions must be documented
- Tests must cover different input cases and error handling
